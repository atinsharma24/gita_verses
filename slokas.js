    "BG 1.1: \n\nधृतराष्ट्र उवाच धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सव: ।  मामका: पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय ॥ १ ॥ \n\nEnglish Translation \n\nDhritarashtra said: O Sanjaya, assembled in the holy land of Kurukshetra and desirous of battle, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do when they had gathered there to fight?", 
    "BG 1.2: Sanjaya said: O King, after observing the Pandavas arranged in military formation, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Drona and spoke the following words.",
    "BG 1.3: O teacher, behold the mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by the son of Drupada, your wise disciple.",
    "BG 1.4: Here in this army, there are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhima and Arjuna; there are also great fighters like Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada, the maharatha (great chariot-warrior).",
    "BG 1.5: There are also great, heroic, powerful fighters like Dhrishtaketu, Cekitana, Kasiraja, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Saibya.",
    "BG 1.6: There are the mighty Yudhamanyu, the very powerful Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi. All these warriors are great chariot-warriors.",
    "BG 1.7: But for your information, O best of the brahmanas, let me tell you about the captains who are especially qualified to lead my military force.",
    "BG 1.8: There are personalities like you, Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta called Bhurishrava, who are always victorious in battle.",
    "BG 1.9: There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. All of them are well equipped with different kinds of weapons, and all are experienced in military science.",
    "BG 1.10: Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bhishma, whereas the strength of the Pandavas, carefully protected by Bhima, is limited.",
    "BG 1.11: All of you must now give full support to Grandfather Bhishma, standing at your respective strategic points in the phalanx of the army.",
    "BG 1.12: Then Bhishma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly, making a sound like the roar of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy.",
    "BG 1.13: After that, the conchshells, drums, bugles, trumpets, and horns were all suddenly sounded, and the combined sound was tumultuous.",
    "BG 1.14: On the other side, both Lord Krishna and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.",
    "BG 1.15: Lord Krishna blew His conchshell, called Panchajanya; Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta; and Bhima, the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell called Paundram.",
    "BG 1.16: King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conchshell, the Anantavijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosha and Manipushpaka.",
    "BG 1.17: The great archer the King of Kasi, the great fighter Sikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata and the unconquerable Satyaki, Drupada, the sons of Draupadi, and the others, O King, such as the son of Subhadra, greatly armed, all blew their respective conchshells.",
    "BG 1.18: The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious, and thus, vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra.",
    "BG 1.19: At that time, Arjuna, the son of Pandu, seated in the chariot bearing the flag marked with Hanuman, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows. O King, after looking at the sons of Dhritarashtra drawn in military array, Arjuna then spoke to Lord Krishna these words.",
    "BG 1.20: Arjuna said: O my dear Krishna, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up.",
    "BG 1.21: My whole body is trembling, my hair is standing on end, my bow Gandiva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.",
    "BG 1.22: I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I see only causes of misfortune, O Krishna, killer of the Keshi demon.",
    "BG 1.23: I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear Krishna, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.",
    "BG 1.24: O Govinda, of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness, or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield? O Madhusudana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, why should I wish to kill them, even though they might otherwise kill me? O maintainer of all creatures, I am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.",
    "BG 1.25: O mighty-armed Krishna, I see assembled in Your body all the demigods and various other living entities. I see Brahma sitting on the lotus flower, as well as Lord Shiva and many sages and divine serpents.",
    "BG 1.26: O Lord of the universe, O universal form, I see in Your body many, many arms, bellies, mouths, and eyes, expanded everywhere, without limit. I see in You no end, no middle, and no beginning.",
    "BG 1.27: Your form is difficult to see because of its glaring effulgence, spreading on all sides, like blazing fire or the immeasurable radiance of the sun. Yet I see this glowing form everywhere, adorned with various crowns, clubs, and discs.",
    "BG 1.28: You are the supreme primal objective. You are the ultimate resting place of all this universe. You are inexhaustible, and You are the oldest. You are the maintainer of the eternal religion, the Personality of Godhead. This is my opinion.",
    "BG 1.29: You are without origin, middle, or end. Your glory is unlimited. You have numberless arms, and the sun and moon are among Your great unlimited eyes. By Your own radiance, You are heating this entire universe.",
    "BG 1.30: Although You are one, You spread throughout the sky and the planets and all space between. O great one, seeing this wondrous and terrible form, all the planetary systems are perturbed.",
    "BG 1.31: I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear Krsna, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.",
    "BG 1.32: O Govinda, of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield? O Madhusudana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, why should I wish to kill them, even though they might otherwise kill me? O maintainer of all living entities, I am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.",
    "BG 1.33: Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore, it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dhrtarastra and our friends. What should we gain, O Krsna, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our own kinsmen?",
    "BG 1.34: O Janardana, although these men, their hearts overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing one's family or quarreling with friends, why should we, with knowledge of the sin, engage in these acts?",
    "BG 1.35: With the destruction of the dynasty, the eternal family tradition is vanquished, and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligion.",
    "BG 1.36: When irreligion is prominent in the family, O Krsna, the women of the family become polluted, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Vrsni, comes unwanted progeny.",
    "BG 1.37: An increase of unwanted population certainly causes hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition. The ancestors of such corrupt families fall down, because the performances for offering them food and water are entirely stopped.",
    "BG 1.38: By the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted children, all kinds of community projects and family welfare activities are devastated.",
    "BG 1.39: O Krsna, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell.",
    "BG 1.40: Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts. Driven by the desire to enjoy royal happiness, we are intent on killing our own kinsmen.",
    "BG 1.41: Better for me if the sons of Dhrtarastra, weapons in hand, were to kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield.",
    "BG 1.42: Sanjaya said: Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief.",
    "BG 1.43: Thus, in the battlefield, Arjuna, the son of Pandu, was overwhelmed with compassion and spoke thus: Arjuna said: My dear Krsna, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up.",
    "BG 1.44: My whole body is trembling, my hair is standing on end, my bow Gandiva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.",
    "BG 1.45: I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I see only causes of misfortune, O Krsna, killer of the Kesi demon.",
    "BG 1.46: I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear Krsna, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.",
    "BG 1.47: O Govinda, of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield? O Madhusudana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, why should I wish to kill them, even though they might otherwise kill me? O maintainer of all living entities, I am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.",
    "BG 2.1: Sanjaya said: Seeing Arjuna full of compassion and very sorrowful, his eyes brimming with tears, Madhusudana, Krishna, spoke the following words.",
    "BG 2.2: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy.",
    "BG 2.3: O son of Pritha, do not yield to this degrading impotence. It does not become you. Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O chastiser of the enemy.",
    "BG 2.4: Arjuna said: O killer of Madhu (Krishna), how can I counterattack with arrows in battle men like Bhisma and Drona, who are worthy of my worship?",
    "BG 2.5: It is better to live in this world by begging than to live at the cost of the lives of great souls who are my teachers. Even though they are avaricious, they are nonetheless superiors. If they are killed, our spoils will be tainted with blood.",
    "BG 2.6: Nor do we know which is better—conquering them or being conquered by them. The sons of Dhritarashtra, whom if we killed we should not care to live, are now standing before us on this battlefield.",
    "BG 2.7: Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness. In this condition, I am asking You to tell me clearly what is best for me. Now I am Your disciple, and a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me.",
    "BG 2.8: I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses. I will not be able to dispel it even if I win an unrivaled kingdom on the earth with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven.",
    "BG 2.9: Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told Krishna, Govinda, I shall not fight, and fell silent.",
    "BG 2.10: O descendant of Bharata, at that time Krishna, smiling, in the midst of both the armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.",
    "BG 2.11: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the dead.",
    "BG 2.12: Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.",
    "BG 2.13: As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change.",
    "BG 2.14: O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.",
    "BG 2.15: O best among men [Arjuna], the person who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation.",
    "BG 2.16: Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent [the material body] there is no endurance and of the eternal [the soul] there is no change. This they have concluded by studying the nature of both.",
    "BG 2.17: That which pervades the entire body you should know to be indestructible. No one is able to destroy that imperishable soul.",
    "BG 2.18: The material body of the indestructible, immeasurable and eternal living entity is sure to come to an end; therefore, fight, O descendant of Bharata.",
    "BG 2.19: He who thinks that the living entity is the slayer or that he is slain, does not understand. One who is in knowledge knows that the self slays not nor is slain.",
    "BG 2.20: For the soul, there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.",
    "BG 2.21: O Partha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, eternal, unborn and immutable kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?",
    "BG 2.22: As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.",
    "BG 2.23: The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.",
    "BG 2.24: This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried. He is everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable, and eternally the same.",
    "BG 2.25: It is said that the soul is invisible, inconceivable, immutable, and unchangeable. Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.",
    "BG 2.26: If, however, you think that the soul [or the symptoms of life] is always born and dies forever, you still have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed.",
    "BG 2.27: For one who has taken his birth, death is certain; and for one who is dead, birth is certain. Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament.",
    "BG 2.28: All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim state, and unmanifest again when they are annihilated. So what need is there for lamentation?",
    "BG 2.29: Some look on the soul as amazing, some describe him as amazing, and some hear of him as amazing, while others, even after hearing about him, cannot understand him at all.",
    "BG 2.30: O descendant of Bharata, he who dwells in the body can never be slain. Therefore, you need not grieve for any living being.",
    "BG 2.31: Considering your specific duty as a kshatriya, you should know that there is no better engagement for you than fighting on religious principles; and so there is no need for hesitation.",
    "BG 2.32: O Partha, happy are the kshatriyas to whom such fighting opportunities come unsought, opening for them the doors of the heavenly planets.",
    "BG 2.33: If, however, you do not perform your religious duty of fighting, then you will certainly incur sins for neglecting your duties and thus lose your reputation as a fighter.",
    "BG 2.34: People will always speak of your infamy, and for one who has been honored, dishonor is worse than death.",
    "BG 2.35: The great generals who have highly esteemed your name and fame will think that you have left the battlefield out of fear only, and thus they will consider you insignificant.",
    "BG 2.36: Your enemies will describe you in many unkind words and scorn your ability. What could be more painful for you?",
    "BG 2.36: Your enemies will speak many unmentionable words and scorn your ability. What could be more painful for you?",
    "BG 2.37: O son of Kunti, either you will be killed on the battlefield and attain the heavenly planets, or you will conquer and enjoy the earthly kingdom. Therefore, get up with determination and fight.",
    "BG 2.38: Do thou fight for the sake of fighting, without considering happiness or distress, loss or gain, victory or defeat—and, by so doing, you shall never incur sin.",
    "BG 2.39: Thus far I have described this knowledge to you through analytical study. Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without fruitive results. O son of Pritha, when you act in such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of works.",
    "BG 2.40: In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.",
    "BG 2.41: Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many-branched.",
    "BG 2.42: There are those who are, in this world, materially successful in following the regulations of the scriptures, and who thus attain higher planets in the afterlife. ",
    "BG 2.43: Yet, there are others who fully renounce such selfish work and become fully absorbed in the devotional service of the Lord, without selfish desires. They are indifferent to success or failure.",
    "BG 2.44: It is due to attachment to the body and its paraphernalia that the embodied soul feels greed and thus suffers material pains.",
    "BG 2.45: The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher than the intelligence.",
    "BG 2.46: One who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that enter like rivers into the ocean which is ever being filled but is always still—can alone achieve peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy such desires.",
    "BG 2.47: You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.",
    "BG 2.48: Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.",
    "BG 2.49: A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that enter like rivers into the ocean which is ever being filled but is always still—can alone achieve peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy such desires.",
    "BG 2.50: A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that enter like rivers into the ocean which is ever being filled but is always still—can alone achieve peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy such desires.",
    "BG 2.51: By thus engaging in devotional service to the Lord, great sages or devotees free themselves from the results of work in the material world. In this way, they become free from the cycle of birth and death and attain the state beyond all miseries [by going back to Godhead].",
    "BG 2.52: When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard.",
    "BG 2.53: When your mind is no longer disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas, and when it remains fixed in the trance of self-realization, then you will have attained the divine consciousness.",
    "BG 2.54: Arjuna said: O Krishna, what are the symptoms of one whose consciousness is thus merged in transcendence? How does he speak, and what is his language? How does he sit, and how does he walk?",
    "BG 2.55: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O Partha, when a person gives up all varieties of desire for sense gratification, which arise from mental concoction, and when his mind, thus purified, finds satisfaction in the self alone, then he is said to be in pure transcendental consciousness.",
    "BG 2.56: One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.",
    "BG 2.57: In the material world, one who is unaffected by whatever good or evil he may obtain, neither praising it nor despising it, is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge.",
    "BG 2.58: One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws its limbs within the shell, is firmly fixed in perfect consciousness.",
    "BG 2.59: What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.",
    "BG 2.60: A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always still—can alone achieve peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy such desires.",
    "BG 2.61: One who restrains his senses and fixes his consciousness upon Me is known as a man of steady intelligence.",
    "BG 2.62: While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises.",
    "BG 2.63: From anger, delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool.",
    "BG 2.64: But a person free from all attachment and aversion and able to control his senses through regulative principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord.",
    "BG 2.65: For one thus satisfied [in Kṛṣṇa consciousness], the threefold miseries of material existence exist no longer; in such satisfied consciousness, one’s intelligence soon becomes steady.",
    "BG 2.66: One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.",
    "BG 2.67: As a strong wind sweeps away a boat on the water, even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a man’s intelligence.",
    "BG 2.68: Therefore, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is certainly of steady intelligence.",
    "BG 2.69: What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.",
    "BG 2.70: A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always still—can alone achieve peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy such desires.",
    "BG 2.71: A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship, and who is devoid of false ego—he alone can attain real peace.",
    "BG 2.72: That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.",
    "BG 3.1: Arjuna said: O Janardana, if You consider knowledge to be superior to work, then why do You urge me to engage in this terrible action?",
    "BG 3.2: You seem to confuse my intelligence by apparently conflicting words. Tell me decisively the one path by which I may attain the highest good.",
    "BG 3.3: The Blessed Lord said: O sinless one, I have already explained that there are two paths in this world—the path of knowledge (Sankhya) for the contemplative, and the path of work (Yoga) for the active.",
    "BG 3.4: One cannot achieve freedom from the bondage of karma by merely abstaining from work. Similarly, one cannot attain perfection by renunciation alone.",
    "BG 3.5: Indeed, no one can remain without performing work even for a moment. Everyone is made to act helplessly under the influence of the modes of material nature.",
    "BG 3.6: One who restrains the senses and organs of action, but whose mind dwells on sense objects, certainly deludes oneself and is called a pretender.",
    "BG 3.7: On the other hand, whoever controls the mind, and is free from attachment, even while using the objects of the senses, does not become entangled in sense gratification.",
    "BG 3.8: Perform your prescribed duties, for action is better than inaction. A man cannot even maintain his physical body without work.",
    "BG 3.9: Work done as a sacrifice for the satisfaction of Vishnu, without selfish desires for results, is alone called action in the mode of goodness.",
    "BG 3.10: All other types of work are actions in the mode of passion. They yield inferior results, temporary and fraught with misery.",
    "BG 3.11: In the material world, those who perform their duties without association with the modes of material nature, without selfish attachment, who are free from all material desires, and who are liberated from dualities, such persons are in the mode of goodness.",
    "BG 3.12: Those who perform their duties motivated by selfish desires, who are obstinate, and who hypocritically proclaim that there is nothing beyond this existence, such individuals are in the mode of passion.",
    "BG 3.13: Those who are bewildered by the mode of ignorance, who are full of laziness, who sleep excessively, and who hold false views, they will not attain spiritual success or self-realization.",
    "BG 3.14: O Arjuna, the mode of goodness makes one's mind pure, the mode of passion conditions the mind through fruitive actions, and the mode of ignorance covers the mind with delusion.",
    "BG 3.15: When knowledge is covered by ignorance and obscured by delusion, this is referred to as the mode of ignorance.",
    "BG 3.16: When one is situated in the mode of goodness, they can understand what is right action and what is wrong action. But when one is situated in the mode of ignorance, they become completely deluded and engage in abominable activities.",
    "BG 3.17: Those who have materialistic intelligence, perform fruitive actions with an eye to the results, and are full of desires, are duplicitous, impure, and attached.",
    "BG 3.18: The transcendentalists, on the other hand, who have controlled their minds, engage their bodies in working for the welfare of others, giving up all attachment to the results of their work, are unaffected by sinful reactions.",
    "BG 3.19: Therefore, without attachment, always perform your duty, which should be done without attachment. For a person who does their duty without attachment attains the Supreme.",
    "BG 3.20: O descendant of Bharata, perform your prescribed duties because action is indeed better than inaction.",
    "BG 3.21: Without performing work, no one can even maintain their physical body. Everyone is forced to act helplessly under the influence of the modes of material nature.",
    "BG 3.22: Those who are motivated only by desire for the fruits of their actions are miserable, for they are constantly anxious about the results of their activities.",
    "BG 3.23: One who is free from all material attachments should always be renounced and should avoid mental speculation. They should remain desireless and should not become materially attached.",
    "BG 3.24: One who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls their mind and senses, is dear to everyone, and everyone is dear to them. Though always working, such a person is never entangled.",
    "BG 3.25: Those who are beyond the dualities that arise from doubts, whose minds are engaged within, who are always busy working for the welfare of all living beings, and who are free from all sins, achieve liberation in the Supreme.",
    "BG 3.26: Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.",
    "BG 3.27: O Arjuna, the materialistic people, who are bewildered by the flowery words of the Vedas, declare that there is nothing beyond this.",
    "BG 3.28: They say that the universe is without truth, without a foundation, and without a God, caused by the interaction of the modes of material nature. They say that it is created by a combination of the three modes of matter.",
    "BG 3.29: Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by the attractive illusory energy of God, and they become devotees of the demigods.",
    "BG 3.30: I, however, am not in them. I am the transcendental Self, the eternal Lord, who exists everywhere and who is all-pervading like the ether.",
    "BG 3.31: All beings follow their nature, and what can repression accomplish? One who restrains the senses, yet keeps thinking about sense objects, is called a pretender.",
    "BG 3.32: One who controls the senses by the mind and intelligence, but continues to contemplate sense objects, is called a hypocrite.",
    "BG 3.33: A person who renounces work but still wants to enjoy the senses is deluding themselves. One truly renounces who neither desires nor hates the fruits of their work.",
    "BG 3.34: The embodied soul who is not motivated by false ego, whose intelligence is not entangled, though engaged in all kinds of work, does not become entangled.",
    "BG 3.35: A person who is free from all attachment, who is neither averse to nor desirous of the fruits of their work, is said to be a sage of steady mind.",
    "BG 3.36: One who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always still—can alone achieve peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy such desires.",
    "BG 3.37: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world.",
    "BG 3.38: As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, similarly, the living entity is covered by different degrees of this lust.",
    "BG 3.39: Thus, a man’s pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire.",
    "BG 3.40: The senses, the mind, and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust. Through them, lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him.",
    "BG 3.41: Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bharatas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin [lust] by controlling the mind with the intellect.",
    "BG 3.42: The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher than the intelligence.",
    "BG 3.43: Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to material intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, subdue this insatiable desire, which is the formidable enemy.",
    
    "BG 4.1: The Supreme Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikshvaku.",
    "BG 4.2: This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of time, the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.",
    "BG 4.3: That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is today told by Me to you because you are My devotee as well as My friend and can therefore understand the transcendental mystery of this science.",
    "BG 4.4: Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasvan is senior by birth to You. How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?",
    "BG 4.5: The Supreme Lord said: Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy!",
    "BG 4.6: Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all living entities, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.",
    "BG 4.7: Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself.",
    "BG 4.8: To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium.",
    "BG 4.9: One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.",
    "BG 4.10: Being freed from attachment, fear, and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me—and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me.",
    "BG 4.11: As all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pritha.",
    "BG 4.12: Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities, and therefore they worship the demigods. Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in this world.",
    "BG 4.13: According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me. And, although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the nondoer, being unchangeable.",
    "BG 4.14: There is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for the fruits of action. One who understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work.",
    "BG 4.15: All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding of My transcendental nature. Therefore you should perform your duty, following in their footsteps.",
    "BG 4.16: Even the intelligent are bewildered in determining what is action and what is inaction. Now I shall explain to you what action is, knowing which you shall be liberated from all misfortune.",
    "BG 4.17: The intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should know properly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is.",
    "BG 4.18: One who sees inaction in action and action in inaction is intelligent among men, and he is in the transcendental position, although engaged in all kinds of work.",
    "BG 4.19: One is understood to be in full knowledge whose every endeavor is devoid of desire for sense gratification. He is said by sages to be a worker for whom the reactions of work have been burned up by the fire of perfect knowledge.",
    "BG 4.20: Abandoning all attachment to the results of his activities, ever satisfied and independent, he performs no fruitive action, although engaged in all kinds of undertakings.",
    "BG 4.21: Such a man of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly controlled, gives up all sense of proprietorship over his possessions, and acts only for the bare necessities of life. Thus working, he is not affected by sinful reactions.",
    "BG 4.22: He who is satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord, who is free from duality and does not envy, who is steady in both success and failure, is never entangled, although performing all kinds of work.",
    "BG 4.23: The work of a man who is unattached to the modes of material nature and who is fully situated in transcendental knowledge merges entirely into transcendence.",
    "BG 4.24: A person who is fully absorbed in Kṛishna consciousness is sure to attain the spiritual kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities, in which the consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the same spiritual nature.",
    "BG 4.25: Some yogis perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to them, and some offer sacrifices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman.",
    "BG 4.26: Some (the unadulterated brahmacharis) sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of mental control, and others (the regulated householders) sacrifice the objects of the senses in the fire of the senses.",
    "BG 4.27: Some (the mystic yogis) again sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the six kinds of yoga practice, and others (the students of empiric philosophy) sacrifice the objects of the senses in the fire of the senses.",
    "BG 4.28: All these performers who know the meaning of sacrifice become cleansed of sinful reactions, and, having tasted the nectar of the remnants of such sacrifice, they go to the supreme eternal atmosphere.",
    "BG 4.29: O best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this planet or in this life: what then of the next?",
    "BG 4.30: All these different types of sacrifice are approved by the Vedas, and all of them are born of different types of work. Knowing them as such, you will become liberated.",
    "BG 4.31: O chastiser of the enemy, the sacrifice performed in knowledge is better than the mere sacrifice of material possessions. After all, O son of Pritha, all sacrifices of work culminate in transcendental knowledge.",
    "BG 4.32: Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.",
    "BG 4.33: Having obtained real knowledge from a self-realized soul, you will never fall again into such illusion, for by this knowledge you will see that all living beings are but part of the Supreme, or, in other words, that they are Mine.",
    "BG 4.34: Even if you are considered to be the most sinful of all sinners, when you are situated in the boat of transcendental knowledge, you will be able to cross over the ocean of miseries.",
    "BG 4.35: As a blazing fire turns firewood to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge burn to ashes all reactions to material activities.",
    "BG 4.36: Thus, in the Vedic literature, the different procedures are prescribed for worshiping different types of demigods. O son of Pritha, please hear from Me about the five yajñas.",
    "BG 4.37: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Just as the performance of all forms of yajña [sacrifice] culminates in knowledge, the suppression of the senses and mind also culminates in knowledge.",
    "BG 4.38: A person is said to be elevated in yoga when, having renounced all material desires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive activities.",
    "BG 4.39: A person is said to have achieved yoga, the union with the Self, when the perfectly disciplined mind gets freedom from all desires, and becomes absorbed in the Self alone.",
    "BG 4.40: One must deliver himself with the help of his mind, and not degrade himself. The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.",
    "BG 4.41: For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who has failed to do so, his mind will remain the greatest enemy.",
    "BG 4.42: For one who is not in control of his mind, it acts like an enemy. For him who has conquered the mind, it acts like a friend. This purified mind is the greatest friend of the conditioned soul.",
  
    "BG 5.1: Arjuna said: O Kṛṣṇa, first of all You ask me to renounce work, and then again You recommend work with devotion. Now, will You kindly tell me definitely which of the two is more beneficial?",
    "BG 5.2: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both good for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than renunciation of work.",
    "BG 5.3: One who neither hates nor desires the fruits of his activities is known to be always renounced. Such a person, free from all dualities, easily overcomes material bondage and is completely liberated, O mighty-armed Arjuna.",
    "BG 5.4: Only the ignorant speak of devotional service [karma-yoga] as being different from the analytical study of the material world [Sāṅkhya]. Those who are actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths achieves the results of both.",
    "BG 5.5: One who knows that the position reached by means of analytical study can also be attained by devotional service, and who therefore sees analytical study and devotional service to be on the same level, sees things as they are.",
    "BG 5.6: But renunciation of work and cessation of all material activities cannot alone save one from the pangs of material existence.",
    "BG 5.7: One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.",
    "BG 5.8: A person in the divine consciousness, although engaged in all kinds of work, does not become entangled, because he knows that the results of all actions are directed by Me, and therefore he is always neutral.",
    "BG 5.9: One who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls his mind and senses is dear to everyone, and everyone is dear to him. Though always working, such a person is never entangled.",
    "BG 5.10: Those who are free from all material desires, who are self-controlled, and who are endowed with the complete knowledge of the Supersoul, attain to the supreme perfection by renunciation of the material world.",
    "BG 5.11: The yogis, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence, and even with the senses, only for the purpose of purification.",
    "BG 5.12: The steadily devoted soul attains unadulterated peace because he offers the result of all activities to Me; whereas a person who is not in union with the Divine, who is greedy for the fruits of his labor, becomes entangled.",
    "BG 5.13: When the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally renounces all actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the material body], neither working nor causing work to be done.",
    "BG 5.14: The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities, nor does he induce people to act, nor does he create the fruits of action. All this is enacted by the modes of material nature.",
    "BG 5.15: Nor does the Supreme Lord assume anyone's sinful or pious activities. Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge.",
    "BG 5.16: When, however, one is enlightened with the knowledge by which nescience is destroyed, then his knowledge reveals everything, as the sun lights up everything in the daytime.",
    "BG 5.17: When one's intelligence, mind, faith, and refuge are all fixed in the Supreme, then one becomes fully cleansed of misgivings through complete knowledge and thus proceeds straight on the path of liberation.",
    "BG 5.18: The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle brāhmaṇa, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater [outcaste].",
    "BG 5.19: Those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already conquered the conditions of birth and death. They are flawless like Brahman, and thus they are already situated in Brahman.",
    "BG 5.20: A person who neither rejoices upon achieving something pleasant nor laments upon obtaining something unpleasant, who is self-intelligent, who is unbewildered, and who knows the science of God, is already situated in transcendence.",
    "BG 5.21: Such a liberated person is not attracted to material sense pleasure but is always in trance, enjoying the pleasure within. In this way, the self-realized person enjoys unlimited happiness, for he concentrates on the Supreme.",
    "BG 5.22: An intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery, which are due to contact with the material senses. O son of Kuntī, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.",
    "BG 5.23: Before giving up this present body, if one is able to tolerate the urges of the material senses and check the force of desire and anger, he is well situated and happy in this world.",
    "BG 5.24: One whose happiness is within, who is active within, who rejoices within, and is illumined within, is actually the perfect mystic. He is liberated in the Supreme, and ultimately he attains the Supreme.",
    "BG 5.25: Those who are beyond the dualities that arise from doubts, whose minds are engaged within, who are always busy working for the welfare of all living beings, and who are free from all sins, achieve liberation in the Supreme.",
    "BG 5.26: Those who are free from anger and all material desires, who are self-realized, self-disciplined, and constantly endeavoring for perfection, are assured of liberation in the Supreme in the very near future.",
    "BG 5.27: Shutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision concentrated between the two eyebrows, suspending the inward and outward breaths within the nostrils, and thus controlling the mind, senses, and intelligence, the transcendentalist becomes free from desire, fear, and anger. One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.",
    "BG 5.28: Knowing Me to be the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.",
    "BG 5.29: A person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimate beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.",
  
    "BG 6.1: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: One who is unattached to the fruits of their work and who works as they are obligated is in the renounced order of life, and they are the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no duty.",
    "BG 6.2: What is called renunciation, you should know to be the same as yoga, or linking oneself with the Supreme, O son of Pandu, for one can never become a yogi unless they renounce the desire for sense gratification.",
    "BG 6.3: For one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be the means; and for one who is already elevated in yoga, cessation of all material activities is said to be the means.",
    "BG 6.4: A person is said to be elevated in yoga when, having renounced all material desires, they neither act for sense gratification nor engage in fruitive activities.",
    "BG 6.5: One must deliver oneself with the help of one's mind, and not degrade oneself. The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and its enemy as well.",
    "BG 6.6: For one who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who has failed to do so, the mind will remain the greatest enemy.",
    "BG 6.7: For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for they have attained tranquility. To such a person, heat and cold, happiness and distress, honor and dishonor are all the same.",
    "BG 6.8: A person is said to be established in self-realization and is called a yogi [or mystic] when they are fully satisfied by virtue of acquired knowledge and realization. Such a person is situated in transcendence and is self-controlled. They see everything—whether it be pebbles, stones or gold—as the same.",
    "BG 6.9: A person is considered still further advanced when they regard all—the honest well-wisher, friends and enemies, the envious, the pious, the sinner and those who are indifferent and impartial—with an equal mind.",
    "BG 6.10: A true yogi observes Me in all beings and also sees every being in Me. Indeed, the self-realized person sees Me, the same Supreme Lord, everywhere.",
    "BG 6.11: One who is not envious but is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor and is free from false ego, who is equal in both happiness and distress, who is tolerant, always satisﬁed, self-controlled, and engaged in devotional service with determination, their mind and intelligence ﬁxed on Me—such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me.",
    "BG 6.12: The yogi who is temperate in their habits of eating, sleeping, working, and recreation can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.",
    "BG 6.13: When the yogi, by practice of yoga, disciplines their mental activities and becomes situated in transcendence, devoid of all material desires, they is said to be well established in yoga.",
    "BG 6.14: As a lamp in a windless place does not waver, so the transcendentalist, whose mind is controlled, remains always steady in their meditation on the transcendent self.",
    "BG 6.15: To practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay kuśa-grass on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth. The seat should be neither too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place.",
    "BG 6.16: The yogi should then sit on it very ﬁrmly and practice yoga to purify the heart by controlling their mind, senses, and activities and ﬁxing the mind on one point.",
    "BG 6.17: Initially, one should meditate upon the lotus feet of the Lord, which are like ﬂashing lightning bolts. Then one should meditate upon the navel of the Lord, which is the foundation of the creation.",
    "BG 6.18: We, from our own practical experience, can declare to the world that there is no spirituality in the material conception of life. Real spirituality begins when one is perfectly pure in heart.",
    "BG 6.19: When one is free from all desires for sense gratiﬁcation, they alone can attain real peace, not the person who strives to satisfy desires.",
    "BG 6.20: A person who is not disturbed by the incessant ﬂow of desires—that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being ﬁlled but is always still—can alone achieve peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy such desires.",
    "BG 6.21: A person who has given up all desires for sense gratiﬁcation, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego—they alone can attain real peace.",
    "BG 6.22: A person who is not disturbed by the incessant ﬂow of desires—that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being ﬁlled but is always still—can alone achieve peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy such desires.",
    "BG 6.23: Before giving up this present body, if one is able to tolerate the urges of the material senses and check the force of desire and anger, they are well situated and happy in this world.",
    "BG 6.24: One whose happiness is within, who is active and rejoices within, and whose aim is inward is actually the perfect mystic. They are liberated in the Supreme, and ultimately, they attain the Supreme.",
    "BG 6.25: Some mystics think that one should surrender to the Supreme and merge into the Supreme. They are also full of compassion and are averse to material desires. They are completely peaceful, and because of their unflinching determination, they are successful in achieving the ultimate goal.",
    "BG 6.26: O Arjun, there are others who, enlightened by sacrificing their material possessions in severe austerities, take strict vows and practice the yoga of eightfold mysticism, and others study the Vedas for the advancement of transcendental knowledge.",
    "BG 6.27: And there are still others who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to remain in trance, and they practice stopping the movement of the outgoing breath into the incoming, and incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at last remain in trance, stopping all breathing. Some of them, curtailing the eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself, as a sacriﬁce.",
    "BG 6.28: All these performers who know the meaning of sacriﬁce become cleansed of sinful reactions, and, having tasted the nectar of the remnants of such sacriﬁce, they go to the supreme eternal atmosphere.",
    "BG 6.29: Persons who are not motivated by false ego, beneﬁt or physical happiness, who are beyond duality and delusion, who are thoroughly peaceful, and who remain unaffected by all material desires, such persons are said to be already situated in the transcendental stage.",
    "BG 6.30: Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. Therefore, they return to the path of birth and death in this material world.",
    "BG 6.31: The yogi who knows that I and the Supersoul within all creatures are one worships Me and remains always in Me in all circumstances.",
    "BG 6.32: O Arjun, I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge, and the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed.",
    "BG 6.33: O mighty-armed Arjun, those who see all creatures as Myself and not differentiating between them by consciousness remain in Me.",
    "BG 6.34: Those who see with eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and can also understand the process of liberation from bondage in material nature, attain to the supreme goal.",
    "BG 6.35: Those who are free from anger and all material desires, who are self-realized, self-disciplined and constantly endeavoring for perfection, are assured of liberation in the Supreme in the very near future.",
    "BG 6.36: O Arjun, as the blazing ﬁre turns ﬁrewood to ashes, O My devotee, so does the ﬂame of knowledge reduce all reactions to ashes.",
    "BG 6.37: The soul who is temperate, self-restrained, benevolent, free from egotism, and attuned to Me in devotional service is dear to Me.",
    "BG 6.38: One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.",
    "BG 6.39: A person is said to have achieved yoga, the union with the Self, when the perfectly disciplined mind gets freedom from all desires, and becomes absorbed in the Self alone.",
    "BG 6.40: A person is said to be transcendentally situated when they do not lament for anything that is lost or does not hanker for anything that is not obtained. A person is said to be self-realized if they are satisfied by themselves, are not engaged in the pursuit of any material desires, and see everything as connected to the Supreme.",
    "BG 6.41: Those who are always satisfied, who are self-controlled, whose minds and intellect are dedicated to Me, and who are free from all desires for material enjoyment, are very dear to Me.",
    "BG 6.42: They for whom I am the supreme goal, who are always steadfast, and who worship Me with devotion, meditating on Me with exclusive devotion, resolved to reach Me, I provide what they lack and preserve what they have.",
    "BG 6.43: O Arjun, those who are full of mercy, who are selfless, free from false ego, benevolent, and possessed of resolve, and who are equipoised in happiness and distress, become dear to Me.",
    "BG 6.44: Those who are indifferent to constant endeavour for self-realization, and those who are not dependent on good or bad results, are liberated from the bondage of materialism.",
    "BG 6.45: A person is considered to be advanced in self-realization when they regard all—whether they be friends, enemies, or even neutral—as equal, and regard everything material as an impediment to their spiritual progress.",
    "BG 6.46: To those who are constantly devoted and who worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.",
    "BG 6.47: Out of compassion for them, I, residing in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.",
  
  
    "BG 7.1: Lord Krishna said: Now hear, O Arjun, how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.",
    "BG 7.2: I shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge, along with its realization. This being known, nothing further shall remain for you to know.",
    "BG 7.3: Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.",
    "BG 7.4: Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence, and false ego—all together these eight constitute My separated material energies.",
    "BG 7.5: Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjun, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.",
    "BG 7.6: Know that all states of being—be they of goodness, passion, or ignorance—are manifested by My energy. I am, in one sense, everything—but I am independent. I am not under the modes of this material nature.",
    "BG 7.7: O scion of Bharat, there is no truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.",
    "BG 7.8: O son of Kunti, I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the moon, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability in man.",
    "BG 7.9: I am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the heat in fire. I am the life of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics.",
    "BG 7.10: O son of Pritha, know that I am the original seed of all existences, the intelligence of the intelligent, and the prowess of all powerful men.",
    "BG 7.11: I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire. I am sex life which is not contrary to religious principles, O Lord of the Bhāratas.",
    "BG 7.12: Know that all states of being—be they of goodness, passion, or ignorance—are manifested by My energy. I am, in one sense, everything—but I am independent. I am not under the modes of this material nature.",
    "BG 7.13: Deluded by the three modes (goodness, passion, and ignorance), the whole world does not know Me, who am above the modes and inexhaustible.",
    "BG 7.14: This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.",
    "BG 7.15: Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.",
    "BG 7.16: Four kinds of pious people render devotional service unto Me—the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.",
    "BG 7.17: Of these, the one who is in full knowledge and who is always engaged in pure devotional service is the best. For I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me.",
    "BG 7.18: All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in knowledge of Me I consider to be just like My own self. Being engaged in My transcendental service, he is sure to attain Me, the highest and most perfect goal.",
    "BG 7.19: After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.",
    "BG 7.20: Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.",
    "BG 7.21: I am in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship some demigod, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to that particular deity.",
    "BG 7.22: Endowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and obtains his desires. But in actuality, these benefits are bestowed by Me alone.",
    "BG 7.23: Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.",
    "BG 7.24: Unintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form and personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature, which is changeless and supreme.",
    "BG 7.25: I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them, I am covered by My eternal creative potency [yoga-maya]; and so the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible.",
    "BG 7.26: O Arjun, I know of the ancient personalities, and also of the rulers of the present. But verily, no one really knows Me.",
    "BG 7.27: O scion of Bharat, know that all opulent, beautiful and glorious creations spring from but a spark of My splendor.",
    "BG 7.28: But what need is there, Arjun, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself, I pervade and support this entire universe.",
    "BG 7.29: Understand that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.",
    "BG 7.30: There is no being—moving or nonmoving—that can exist without Me.",
    "BG 8.1: Arjuna said: O Madhusūdana, O Kṛṣṇa, O Yadava, O Hṛṣīkeśa, Govinda, O Kṛṣṇa, Ācārya, please tell me decisively which of the two is more beneficial.",
    "BG 8.2: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The indestructible transcendental living entity is called Brahman, and its eternal nature is called the self. Action pertaining to the development of these material bodies is called karma, or fruitive activities.",
    "BG 8.3: Some learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth say that it is nondual knowledge and is called impersonal Brahman, Paramātmā or the all-pervading Supersoul.",
    "BG 8.4: Yet there are others who are inclined to the process of jñāna-yoga, the cultivation of knowledge. They are also devoted, full of faith, and always seeking the Supreme Goal.",
    "BG 8.5: Some yogīs perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to them, and some offer sacrifices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman.",
    "BG 8.6: Some newly risen yogīs—equipped with transcendental knowledge by worshiping the Supreme Person—attain the complete cessation of material existence.",
    "BG 8.7: Others, who are interested in achieving self-realization through control of the mind and senses, offer the functions of all the senses, as well as the life breath, as oblations into the fire of the controlled mind.",
    "BG 8.8: There are yet others who are interested in the process of breath restraint to remain in trance, and they practice stopping the movement of the outgoing breath into the incoming, and the incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at last remain in trance, stopping all breathing. Some of them, curtailing the eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself, as a sacrifice.",
    "BG 8.9: All these performers who know the meaning of sacrifice become cleansed of sinful reactions, and, having tasted the nectar of the remnants of such sacrifice, they go to the supreme eternal atmosphere.",
    "BG 8.10: O best of the Kurus, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this planet or in this life: what then of the next?",
    "BG 8.11: A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always still—can alone achieve peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy such desires.",
    "BG 8.12: A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas, performing sacrifices, undergoing austerities, giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. Simply by performing devotional service, he attains all these, and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal abode.",
    "BG 8.13: I shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal. Brahman, the spirit, beginningless and subordinate to Me, lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world.",
    "BG 8.14: Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes, heads, and faces, and He has ears everywhere. In this way, the Supersoul exists, pervading everything.",
    "BG 8.15: The Supreme Truth exists outside and inside of all living beings, the moving and the nonmoving. Because He is subtle, He is incomprehensible to the material senses. Although far, far away, He is also near to all.",
    "BG 8.16: Although the Supersoul appears to be divided among all beings, He is never divided. He is situated as one. Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is to be understood that He devours and develops all.",
    "BG 8.17: He is the source of light in all luminous objects. He is beyond the darkness of matter and is unmanifested. He is knowledge, He is the object of knowledge, and He is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone’s heart.",
    "BG 8.18: Thus, the field of activities [the body], knowledge, and the knowable have been summarily described by Me. Only My devotees can understand this thoroughly and thus attain to My nature.",
    "BG 8.19: Now I shall explain the process of knowing the self, which is the ultimate goal of life. By knowing this, a person will attain to the supreme goal.",
    "BG 8.20: Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature.",
    "BG 8.21: The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.",
    "BG 8.22: The living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of ear, tongue, and nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He thus enjoys a particular set of sense objects.",
    "BG 8.23: The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a person endowed with discrimination and practicing control.",
    "BG 8.24: One who restrains his senses, keeping them under full control, and fixes his consciousness upon Me, is known as a man of steady intelligence.",
    "BG 8.25: While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises.",
    "BG 8.26: From anger, complete delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool.",
    "BG 8.27: The yogī who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal auspiciousness, whereas the unsuccessful yogī, by false practice, is in fact a failure due to his deviations from the path.",
    "BG 8.28: One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.",
    "BG 9.1: The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjun, because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you this most secret wisdom, knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence.",
    "BG 9.2: This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.",
    "BG 9.3: Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. Therefore, they return to the path of birth and death in this material world.",
    "BG 9.4: This entire cosmic manifestation is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest form. All living beings dwell in Me, but I do not dwell in them.",
    "BG 9.5: And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities and although I am everywhere, I am not a part of this cosmic manifestation, for My Self is the very source of creation.",
    "BG 9.6: Understand that as the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, rests always in the sky, all created beings rest in Me.",
    "BG 9.7: At the end of the millennium, all material manifestations enter into My nature, and at the beginning of another millennium, by My potency, I create them again.",
    "BG 9.8: The whole cosmic order is under Me. By My will, it is manifested again and again, and by My will, it is annihilated at the end.",
    "BG 9.9: O Dhananjay, all this work cannot bind Me. I am ever detached from all these material activities, seated as though neutral.",
    "BG 9.10: This material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, producing all moving and nonmoving beings. Under its rule, this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.",
    "BG 9.11: Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.",
    "BG 9.12: Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.",
    "BG 9.13: O son of Pritha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.",
    "BG 9.14: Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.",
    "BG 9.15: Others, who engage in sacrifice by the cultivation of knowledge, worship the Supreme Lord as the one without a second, as diverse in many, and in the universal form.",
    "BG 9.16: But it is I who am the ritual, I the sacrifice, the offering to the ancestors, the healing herb, the transcendental chant. I am the butter and the fire and the offering.",
    "BG 9.17: I am the father of this universe, the mother, the support, and the grandsire. I am the object of knowledge, the purifier, and the syllable oṁ. I am also the Ṛg, the Sāma, and the Yajur Vedas.",
    "BG 9.18: I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge, and the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place, and the eternal seed.",
    "BG 9.19: O Arjun, I give heat, and I withhold and send forth the rain. I am immortality, and I am also death personified. Both spirit and matter are in Me.",
    "BG 9.20: Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly planets, worship Me indirectly. Purified of sinful reactions, they take birth on the pious, heavenly planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights.",
    "BG 9.21: When they have thus enjoyed vast heavenly sense pleasure and the results of their pious activities are exhausted, they return to this mortal planet again. Thus, those who seek sense enjoyment by adhering to the principles of the three Vedas achieve only repeated birth and death.",
    "BG 9.22: Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; and those who worship Me will live with Me.",
    "BG 9.23: If you offer Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit, or water, I will accept it.",
    "BG 9.24: Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever you give, and whatever austerities you perform—do that as an offering to Me.",
    "BG 9.25: In this way, you will be freed from all reactions to good and evil deeds, and by this principle of renunciation, you will be liberated and come to Me.",
    "BG 9.26: Those who are free from false prestige, illusion, and false association, who understand the eternal, who are done with material lust, who are freed from the dualities of happiness and distress, and who, unbewildered, know how to surrender unto the Supreme Person, attain to that eternal kingdom.",
    "BG 9.27: I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to them.",
    "BG 9.28: Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service, he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated in his determination.",
    "BG 9.29: I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to them.",
    "BG 9.30: Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if they are devoted to Me, they are considered saintly because they are properly situated in their determination.",
    "BG 9.31: Quickly they become virtuous and attain lasting peace. O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.",
    "BG 9.32: Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to the path of birth and death in this material world.",
    "BG 9.33: All those who take shelter in Me, though they may be of lower birth—women, vaiśyas [merchants], as well as śūdras [workers]—can approach the supreme destination.",
    "BG 9.34: How much more this is so of the righteous brāhmaṇas, the devotees and the saintly kings. Therefore, having come to this temporary, miserable world, engage in loving service unto Me.",
    "BG 10.1: The Lord said: Listen again to My divine teachings, O mighty armed one. Desiring your welfare because you are My beloved friend, I shall reveal them to you.",
    "BG 10.2: Neither celestial gods nor the great sages know of My origin. I am the source from which the gods and great seers come.",
    "BG 10.3: Those who know Me as unborn and beginningless, and as the Supreme Lord of the universe, they among mortals are free from illusion and released from all evils.",
    "BG 10.4: From Me alone arise the varieties of qualities in humans, such as intellect, knowledge, clarity of thought, forgiveness, truthfulness, control over the senses and mind, joy and sorrow, birth and death, fear and courage, non-violence, equanimity, contentment, austerity, charity, fame, and infamy.",
    "BG 10.5: From Me alone arise the varieties of qualities in humans, such as intellect, knowledge, clarity of thought, forgiveness, truthfulness, control over the senses and mind, joy and sorrow, birth and death, fear and courage, non-violence, equanimity, contentment, austerity, charity, fame, and infamy.",
    "BG 10.6: The seven great Sages, the four great Saints before them, and the fourteen Manus, are all born from My mind. From them, all the people in the world have descended.",
    "BG 10.7: Those who know in truth My glories and divine powers become united with Me through unwavering Bhakti Yog. Of this there is no doubt.",
    "BG 10.8: I am the origin of all creation. Everything proceeds from Me. The wise who know this perfectly worship Me with great faith and devotion.",
    "BG 10.9: With their minds fixed on Me and their lives surrendered to Me, My devotees remain ever content in Me. They derive great satisfaction and bliss in enlightening one another about Me and in conversing about My glories.",
    "BG 10.10: To those whose minds are always united with Me in loving devotion, I give the divine knowledge by which they can attain Me.",
    "BG 10.11: Out of compassion for them, I, who dwell within their hearts, destroy the darkness born of ignorance, with the luminous lamp of knowledge.",
    "BG 10.12: Arjun said: You are the Supreme Divine Personality, the Supreme Abode, the Supreme Purifier, the Eternal God, the Primal Being, the Unborn, and the Greatest. The great sages, like Narad, Asit, Deval, and Vyas, proclaimed this, and now You are declaring it to me Yourself.",
    "BG 10.13: Arjun said: You are the Supreme Divine Personality, the Supreme Abode, the Supreme Purifier, the Eternal God, the Primal Being, the Unborn, and the Greatest. The great sages, like Narad, Asit, Deval, and Vyas, proclaimed this, and now You are declaring it to me Yourself.",
    "BG 10.14: Indeed, You alone know Yourself by Your inconceivable energy, O Supreme Personality, the Creator and Lord of all beings, the God of gods, and the Lord of the universe!",
    "BG 10.15: Please describe to me Your divine opulences, by which You pervade all the worlds and reside in them. O Supreme Master of Yog, how may I know You and think of You. And while meditating, in what forms can I think of You, O Supreme Divine Personality?",
    "BG 10.16: Please describe to me Your divine opulences, by which You pervade all the worlds and reside in them. O Supreme Master of Yog, how may I know You and think of You. And while meditating, in what forms can I think of You, O Supreme Divine Personality?",
    "BG 10.17: Tell me again in detail Your divine glories and manifestations, O Janardan. I can never tire of hearing your nectar.",
    "BG 10.18: The Lord spoke: I shall now briefly describe My divine glories to you, O best of the Kurus, for there is no end to their detail.",
    "BG 10.21: O Arjun, I am seated in the heart of all living entities. I am the beginning, middle, and end of all beings.",

    "BG 11.25: Having seen Your many mouths bearing Your terrible teeth, resembling the raging fire at the time of annihilation, I forget where I am and do not know where to go. O Lord of lords, You are the shelter of the universe; please have mercy on me.",
    "BG 11.26: I see all the sons of Dhritarashtra, along with their allied kings, including Bheeshma, Dronacharya, Karn, and also the generals from our side, rushing headlong into Your fearsome mouths. I see some with their heads smashed between Your terrible teeth.",
    "BG 11.27: I see all the sons of Dhritarashtra, along with their allied kings, including Bheeshma, Dronacharya, Karn, and also the generals from our side, rushing headlong into Your fearsome mouths. I see some with their heads smashed between Your terrible teeth.",
    "BG 11.28: As many waves of the rivers flowing rapidly into the ocean, so are all these great warriors entering into Your blazing mouths. As moths rush with great speed into the fire to perish, so are all these armies entering with great speed into Your mouths.",
    "BG 11.29: As many waves of the rivers flowing rapidly into the ocean, so are all these great warriors entering into Your blazing mouths. As moths rush with great speed into the fire to perish, so are all these armies entering with great speed into Your mouths.",
    "BG 11.30: With Your fiery tongues You are licking up the hosts of living beings on all sides and devouring them with Your blazing mouths. O Vishnu, You are scorching the entire universe with the fierce, all-pervading rays of Your effulgence.",
    "BG 11.31: Tell me who You are, so fierce of form. O God of gods, I bow before You; please bestow Your mercy on me. You, who existed before all creation, I wish to know who You are, for I do not comprehend Your nature and workings.",
    "BG 11.32: The Supreme Lord said: I am mighty Time, the source of destruction that comes forth to annihilate the worlds. Even without your participation, the warriors arrayed in the opposing army shall cease to exist.",
    "BG 11.33: Therefore, arise and attain honor! Conquer your foes and enjoy prosperous rulership. These warriors stand already slain by Me, and you will only be an instrument of My work, O expert archer.",
    "BG 11.34: Dronacharya, Bheeshma, Jayadratha, Karn, and other brave warriors have already been killed by Me. Therefore, slay them without being disturbed. Just fight and you will be victorious over your enemies in battle.",
    "BG 11.35: Sanjay said: Hearing these words of Keshav, Arjun trembled with dread. With palms joined, he bowed before Shree Krishna and spoke in a faltering voice, overwhelmed with fear.",
    "BG 11.36: Arjun said: O Master of the senses, it is but apt that the universe rejoices in giving You praise and is enamored by You. Demons flee fearfully from You in all directions and hosts of perfected saints bow to You.",
    "BG 11.37: O Great One, who are even greater than Brahma, the original creator, why should they not bow to you? O Limitless One, O Lord of the devatās, O Refuge of the universe, You are the imperishable reality beyond both the manifest and the non-manifest.",
    "BG 11.38: You are the primeval God and the original Divine Personality; You are the sole resting place of this universe. You are both the knower and the object of knowledge; You are the Supreme Abode. O possessor of infinite forms, You alone pervade the entire universe.",
    "BG 11.39: You are Vāyu (god of wind), Yamraj (god of death), Agni (god of fire), Varuṇ (god of water), and Chandra (moon-god). You are the creator Brahma, and the Great-grandfather of all beings. I offer my salutations unto You a thousand times, again and yet again!",

    "BG 11.41: Thinking of You as my friend, I presumptuously addressed You as, “O Krishna,” “O Yadav,” “O my dear Friend.” I was ignorant of Your majesty, showing negligence and undue affection. And if, jestfully, I treated You with disrespect, while playing, resting, sitting, eating, when alone, or before others—for all that I crave forgiveness.",
    "BG 11.42: Thinking of You as my friend, I presumptuously addressed You as, “O Krishna,” “O Yadav,” “O my dear Friend.” I was ignorant of Your majesty, showing negligence and undue affection. And if, jestfully, I treated You with disrespect, while playing, resting, sitting, eating, when alone, or before others—for all that I crave forgiveness.",
    "BG 11.43: You are the Father of the entire universe, of all moving and non-moving beings. You are the most deserving of worship and the Supreme Spiritual Master. When there is none equal to You in all the three worlds, then who can possibly be greater than You, O Possessor of incomparable power?",
    "BG 11.44: Therefore, O adorable Lord, bowing deeply and prostrating before You, I implore You for Your grace. As a father tolerates his son, a friend forgives his friend, and a lover pardons the beloved, please forgive me for my offences.",
    "BG 11.45: Having seen Your universal form that I had never seen before, I feel great joy. And yet, my mind trembles with fear. Please have mercy on me and again show me Your pleasing form, O God of gods, O Abode of the universe.",
    "BG 11.46: O Thousand-armed One, though You are the embodiment of all creation, I wish to see You in Your four-armed form, carrying the mace and disc, and wearing the crown.",

    "BG 15.2: The branches of the tree extend upward and downward, nourished by the three guṇas, with the objects of the senses as tender buds. The roots of the tree hang downward, causing the flow of karma in the human form. Below, its roots branch out causing (karmic) actions in the world of humans."  ,

But this deep-rooted aśhvatth tree must be cut down with a strong axe of detachment.

    "BG 15.6: Neither the sun nor the moon, nor fire can illumine that Supreme Abode of Mine. Having gone There, one does not return to this material world again.",
    "BG 15.7: The embodied souls in this material world are My eternal fragmental parts. But bound by material nature, they are struggling with the six senses including the mind.",
    "BG 15.8: As the air carries fragrance from place to place, so does the embodied soul carry the mind and senses with it, when it leaves an old body and enters a new one.",
    "BG 15.9: Using the sense perceptions of the ears, eyes, skin, tongue, and nose, which are grouped around the mind, the embodied soul savors the objects of the senses.",
