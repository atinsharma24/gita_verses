# Gita Sloka Generator

Welcome to the Gita Sloka Generator, 
an interactive web application designed to explore the profound spiritual wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita â€“ an ancient Indian scripture. 
The Bhagavad Gita is presented as a conversation between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. 
This dialogue takes place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, just before a great war between two factions of the same royal family, the Pandavas, and the Kauravas. The Gita addresses timeless philosophical questions, offering guidance on duty, righteousness, self-realization, devotion, knowledge, and selfless action.

## Features:

1. **Chapter Selection:** You can choose a specific chapter from the Bhagavad Gita using a user-friendly dropdown menu. The selected chapter will be displayed alongside its title.

2. **Sloka Display:** After selecting a chapter, you can read the verses (slokas) from that particular chapter. The slokas are displayed one by one, enabling you to dive into the profound teachings of each section.

3. **Navigation:** The application provides navigation buttons for easy browsing between slokas. You can move to the next sloka, the previous one, or even generate a random sloka for a serendipitous reading experience.

## Technologies Used:

1. **HTML:** The project's structure and content are created using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).

2. **CSS (Tailwind CSS):** To enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the application, we utilized Tailwind CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework.

3. **JavaScript:** The interactive functionality of the Gita Sloka Generator is powered by JavaScript. It enables the dynamic selection and display of slokas based on user interactions.

4. **Web Hosting:** The web application is hosted on a web server, making it accessible to users across the internet.
