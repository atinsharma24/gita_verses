  "description": "Welcome to the Gita Sloka Generator,  an interactive web application designed to explore the profound spiritual wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita â€“ an ancient Indian scripture.  The Bhagavad Gita is presented as a conversation between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna, who serves as his charioteer.  This dialogue takes place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, just before a great war between two factions of the same royal family, the Pandavas, and the Kauravas. The Gita addresses timeless philosophical questions, offering guidance on duty, righteousness, self-realization, devotion, knowledge, and selfless action.",
